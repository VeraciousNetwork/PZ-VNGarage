## Tire Rack

![Tire Rack](src/poster.png)

The tire rack is a storage container that can hold up to 12 tires, (or more if you are organized).
This is a 1x1 tile object that can be placed on the ground and accepts just tires.

A notable feature of this tire rack is that it displays the amount of tires stored.
ie: if you store 5 tires, you will see 5 tires on the rack.
